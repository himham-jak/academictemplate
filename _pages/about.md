To achieve the unique purpose I set out for in creating this website, I feel the need to explain myself. That is to say that I think it’s natural to have to provide background to newcomers on something which is meant to be novel. Paraphrasing one of my childhood teachers, “The reader can only read the page, not your mind.” And though it’s true that one of the primary purposes of this website is for me to gain experience putting my mind to the page, there are few things I find as satisfying as knowing my work reaches others and has a positive impact on them as well. To that end, I think it would be prudent to state some core theses that I hold, which will be pervasive on the site and in my other writings. I will periodically make revisions as needed.

Logical construction is a form of art
======
In general, I find the modern boundaries of what we consider a genre of art or science to be much too limiting. There have been those who push back against this notion by trying to reclaim the title of polymath from the likes of Da Vinci and Newton, positioning themselves as the Neo to the art world’s Matrix, so familiar with the blurred lines that they live and die fighting wars on the borders. In truth, the polymaths of the past readily recognized the distinctions between arts, politics, and math. Many of the narrow definitions we struggle to find room in were imposed during the exact time that they lived. These few exceptional figures only had one personal trait which sets them apart from their modern analogue: they saw inherently political, mathematical, and artistic people within themselves. They recognized that the feature which tied these pursuits together was the human experience itself.

In much the same way that the cold, logical linguistics of literary prose can construct a beautiful sonnet or a series of novels, I see architectures of bytes and data as similarly unfeeling building blocks that nonetheless contain endless potential for distinctly human interactions. This will manifest itself in how I present topics. For instance, I may refer to a piece of software as art, and thus I may analyze the inherent politics embedded in that art. I may refer to the content or messaging of something like a feature-length film as “the text” of that film.

Art is inherently political
======
Simply by recognizing that art is a human interaction, we know with a certainty that there will be bias within that interaction. There is no art which does not hold a piece of the artist within it. In practice, the term artist is often claimed exclusively by those who use their puzzle pieces strategically, whether for social commentary or direct protest. Even those who aim to use their artistic vision for the preservation of current systems are engaging in politics.
